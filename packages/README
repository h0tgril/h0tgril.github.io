The audio, models, and textures ARE NOT MADE BY US, but we used them in some of our maps, so they're included here for your convenience.

Merge these files into your AssaultCube user packages directory. (If you're using a Mac, the default is ~/Library/Application Support/assaultcube/v1.3/packages)

kk_ = KimKardashian
hg_ = hot_gril

Happy cubing!
